# Google places plugin of RADAR-pRMT

Plugin to monitor the user location data. Location data is tracked via Google Places API.

This plugin requires the Android any of `ACCESS_COARSE_LOCATION` or `ACCESS_FINE_LOCATION` and for android devices running on Android 10 or higher it requires additional `ACCESS_BACKGROUND_LOCATION` permission. To ensure the accuracy of the data, please do not disregard the `ACCESS_FINE_LOCATION` permission. Failure to grant this permission may result in erratic behavior and the cessation of plugin functionality.

## Installation

To add the plugin code to your app, add the following snippet to your app's `build.gradle` file.

```gradle
dependencies {
    implementation "org.radarbase:radar-android-google-places:$radarCommonsAndroidVersion"
}
```

Add `org.radarbase.passive.google.places.GooglePlacesProvider` to the `plugins` variable of the `RadarService` instance in your app.

## Configuration

To enable this plugin, add the provider `google_places` to `plugins` property of the configuration.

This plugin takes the following Firebase configuration parameters:

This plugin produces data for the following topics: (types starts with `org.radarcns.passive.google` prefix)

| Topic                        | Type               | Description                                                                                                                                   |

| `android_google_places_info` | `GooglePlacesInfo` | Information of places where the userâ€™s device is last known to be located along with an indication of the relative likelihood for each place. |
