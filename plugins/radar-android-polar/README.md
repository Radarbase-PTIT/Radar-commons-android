# Polar plugin RADAR-pRMT

Application to be run on an Android 5.0 (or later) device with Bluetooth Low Energy (Bluetooth 4.0 or later), to interact with a Polar device.

The plugin application uses Bluetooth Low Energy requirement, making it require coarse location permissions. This plugin does not collect location information.

This plugin connects to a Polar device, of which the deviceId is hardcoded in PolarManager.

This plugin has currently been tested with the Polar H10, Polar Vantage V3 and Polar Verity Sense, of which the following topics are implemented:

| Polar device                   | Topic                       | Description                                                |
|--------------------------------|-----------------------------|------------------------------------------------------------| 
| Polar H10 | android_polar_battery_level | Battery level |
|  | android_polar_heart_rate    | Heart rate (bpm) with sample rate 1Hz|
|  | android_polar_ecg           | Electrocardiography (ECG) data in ÂµV with sample rate 130Hz|
|  | android_polar_acceleration  | Accelerometer data with a sample rate of 25Hz, a resoltion of 16 and range of 2G. Axis specific acceleration data in mG.|
| Polar Vantage V3 | android_polar_battery_level | Battery level|
|  | android_polar_heart_rate    | Heart rate (bpm) in 1Hz frequency|
| Polar Verity Sense | android_polar_battery_level | Battery level|
|  | android_polar_heart_rate    | Heart rate (bpm) with sample rate 1Hz|
|  | android_polar_ppg           | PPG data with a sample rate of 55Hz, a resolution of 22 using 4 channels. |
|  | android_polar_ppi           | PP interval representing cardiac pulse-to-pulse interval extracted from PPG signal.|

## Installation

To add the plugin code to your app, add the following snippet to your app's `build.gradle` file.

```gradle
repositories {
    maven { url 'https://jitpack.io' }
}

dependencies {
    implementation "org.radarbase:radar-android-polar:$radarCommonsAndroidVersion"
    implementation 'com.github.polarofficial:polar-ble-sdk:5.5.0'
    implementation 'io.reactivex.rxjava3:rxjava:3.1.6'
    implementation 'io.reactivex.rxjava3:rxandroid:3.0.2'
}
```

Add `org.radarbase.passive.polar.PolarProvider` to the `plugins` variable of the `RadarService` instance in your app.

## Configuration

Add the provider `.polar.PolarProvider` to the Firebase Remote Config `plugins` variable.

## Contributing

This plugin was build using the [POLAR BLE SDK][1].

## Information

On the **Polar Vantage V3**, streaming data is only possible when a training session is started on the watch (see https://github.com/polarofficial/polar-ble-sdk/issues/456).

Here are the instructions how to start data streaming:

1. Have a phone running the app with Polar SDK paired with the watch. 
2. The sensor data sharing must be enabled for the phone in the watch pairing menu (General settings/Pair and sync/Paired devices/SDK/Share).
3. Go to the 'Start training' -menu in watch and choose the desired sport profile.
4. On phone running the app with Polar SDK connect phone with watch.
5. Start the recording in the app.
6. On the watch start the training recording or stay in 'Start training' -menu.

Note! When streaming data we would recommend removing Polar Flow app from the mobile if it was installed. All other phones or Polar devices not used for streaming should be shut down or at least Bluetooth turned off. 
Also after each streaming session you might need to go back to the watch mode before starting a new exercise & streaming session.
