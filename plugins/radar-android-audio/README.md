# Audio RADAR-pRMT

Audio plugin for the RADAR passive remote monitoring app. It uses openSMILE to process audio from
the phone's microphone, extracts features from it, and sends those features. 

## Installation

To add the plugin code to your app, add the following snippet to your app's `build.gradle` file.

```gradle
dependencies {
    implementation "org.radarbase:radar-android-audio:$radarCommonsAndroidVersion"
}
```

Add `org.radarbase.passive.audio.OpenSmileAudioProvider` to the `plugins` variable of the `RadarService` instance in your app.

## Configuration

To enable this plugin, add the provider `opensmile_audio` to `plugins` property of the configuration.

| Parameter | Type | Default | Description |
| --------- | ---- | ------- | ----------- |
| `audio_duration` | int (seconds) | 15 | Length in seconds of the audio recording when it started.  |
| `audio_record_rate` | int (seconds) | 3600 | Default interval between two consecutive audio recordings.  |
| `audio_config_file` | string (filepath) | "ComParE_2016.conf" |  Path to openSMILE configuration file. |

Config files are addressed relative to the path `src/main/assets/org/radarbase/passive/audio/opensmile`.

_Please note_:
The *actual* audio recording duration is stated here:

```
src/main/assets/org/radarbase/passive/audio/opensmile/shared/FrameModeFunctionals.conf.inc
```

However, the `audio_duration` parameter from the RadarConfiguration parameters only tells after
which time period a termination signal should be sent to the openSMILE feature extraction thread.
So `audio_duration` and `frameSize` and `frameStep` in FrameModeFunctionals.conf.inc must all be set
together correctly such that all values correspond to each other.

This plugin produces data for the following topics: (types starts with `org.radarcns.passive.opensmile` namespace)

| Topic | Type | Description |
| ----- | ---- | ----------- |
| `android_processed_audio` | `OpenSmile2PhoneAudio` | Raw base-64 encoded data, according to the provided config file. |
